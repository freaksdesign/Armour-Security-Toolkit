- What is spyware?
  - Spyware is a type of malware that collects and sends information about a user's computer or network to an attacker, often used to steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data.

- What is adware?
  - Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted or intrusive advertisements on a user's computer or device, often used to generate revenue for the attacker.

- What is a rootkit?
  - A rootkit is a type of malware that hides its presence and activities from system administrators and security software, often used to gain unauthorized access to a user's computer or network.

- What is a botnet?
  - A botnet is a network of infected computers or devices controlled by a single attacker, often used to carry out coordinated attacks or spam campaigns.

- What is a backdoor?
  - A backdoor is a hidden and unauthorized entry point into a computer or network system, often used by attackers to gain access and carry out malicious activities.

- What is fileless malware?
  - Fileless malware is a type of malware that operates in the computer's memory without leaving a trace on the system's hard drive, often used to evade detection by traditional antivirus software.

- What is a banking Trojan?
  - A banking Trojan is a type of malware that targets online banking systems, often used to steal login credentials and financial information from victims.

- What is cryptojacking malware?
  - Cryptojacking malware is a type of malware that hijacks a user's computer or device to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or consent, often causing system slowdowns and increased energy consumption.

- What is polymorphic malware?
  - Polymorphic malware is a type of malware that uses advanced techniques to change its code and evade detection by traditional antivirus software, often making it more difficult to detect and remove.

- What is a macro virus?
  - A macro virus is a type of virus that infects Microsoft Office documents and uses macros to execute malicious code, often used to spread malware through email attachments and other documents.

- What is a boot sector virus?
  - A boot sector virus is a type of virus that infects the boot sector of a computer's hard drive or diskette, often used to gain control over the system and carry out malicious activities.

- What is a multipartite virus?
  - A multipartite virus is a type of virus that infects both the boot sector and executable files on a computer, often causing damage to both system files and user data.

- What is a stealth virus?
  - A stealth virus is a type of virus that hides its presence and activities from system administrators and antivirus software, often used to evade detection and spread throughout a network.

- What is an armored virus?
  - An armored virus is a type of virus that uses encryption and other techniques to protect itself from antivirus software and other security measures, often making it more difficult to detect and remove.

- What is mobile malware?
  - Mobile malware is a type of malware designed to infect and exploit mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, often used to steal personal information, display unwanted advertisements, or carry out other malicious activities.

- What is a logic bomb?
  - A logic bomb is a type of malware that is triggered by a specific event or set of conditions, often used to cause damage or disruption to a computer or network system.

- What is a dropper?
  - A dropper is a type of malware that is used to deliver other malware programs onto a victim's computer or network system, often used to evade detection by antivirus software.

- What is a rootkit scanner?
  - A rootkit scanner is a type of software used to detect and remove rootkits from a computer or network system, often used to prevent unauthorized access and maintain system security.

- What is an antivirus software?
  - Antivirus software is a type of software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware from computer and network systems, often used to protect against cyber threats and maintain system security.

- What is a firewall?
  - A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, often used to prevent unauthorized access and protect against cyber attacks.

- What is a sandbox?
  - A sandbox is a testing environment used to isolate and execute potentially malicious software, often used to test software behavior and prevent damage to the underlying system.

- What is heuristic analysis?
  - Heuristic analysis is a method used by antivirus software to detect and identify new and unknown malware threats, often used to identify and respond to emerging cyber threats.

- What is a honeypot?
  - A honeypot is a decoy system designed to attract and trap attackers, often used to gather information about attacker behavior and prevent attacks on real systems.

- What is a zero-day vulnerability?
  - A zero-day vulnerability is a software vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor or developer, often used by attackers to exploit systems and carry out cyber attacks.

- What is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack?
  - A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attack in which multiple compromised computer systems are used to flood a targeted website or server with traffic, often causing the system to crash or become unavailable.

- What is social engineering?
  - Social engineering is a type of attack that uses psychological manipulation to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that can be exploited by attackers.

- What is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack?
  - A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is an attack in which a third party intercepts communication between two parties and can eavesdrop or manipulate the communication, often used to steal sensitive information.
